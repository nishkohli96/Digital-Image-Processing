   Applying Filters and Transforming Images in Matlab

    S=imread('C:\Users\HP\Downloads\lena.tif');

   1.  2D FFT of an image

        Y=fft2(double(S));
        Y=abs(Y);
        R=fftshift(Y);
        R=abs(R);
        imshow(R);

   2.  Ideal Low Pass Filter

        idealfilter(S,20,'lpf');    where 20 is the cutoff frequency

   3.  Ideal High Pass Filter

        idealfilter(S,20,'hpf'); 

   4.  ButterWorth Low Pass Filter

         
   5.  ButterWorth High Pass Filter

        ButterWorth(2,50,S,'hpf');

   6.  Gaussian High Pass Filter

        H = padarray(2,[2 2]) - fspecial('gaussian' ,[5 5],2);
        sharpened = imfilter(S,H);  % create a sharpened version of the image using that mask
        imshow(sharpened);

   7.  Gaussian Low Pass Filter

        Iblur = imgaussfilt(S, 2);

   8.  Salt and Pepper Noise

        J = imnoise(S,'salt & pepper',0.02);

   9.  Poisson Noise

        J = imnoise(S,'poisson');

  10.  Gaussian Noise

        J = imnoise(S,'gaussian',0,0.01);  %Mean and variance    

  11.  Arithmetic Mean Filter

        G=imnoise(S,'gaussian',0.0005,0.0019);
        h = fspecial('average', 3);
        F=imfilter(G,h);
        imshow(F);

  12.  Median Filter

        Y=medfilt2(S,[5 5]);
